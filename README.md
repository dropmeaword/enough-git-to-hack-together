These are my [class notes](NOTES.md) for an introduction to Git.

The [PITCHME.md](PITCHME.md) file can be [rendered as slides here](https://gitpitch.com/dropmeaword/enough-git-to-hack-together#/).

After the theoretical introducton and explaning the basic concepts and the most usual workflow we do an exercise to exemplify a collaborative workflow. For this exercise we use the Beatles White Album as source material. You can find the [repo of the exercise here](https://github.com/IDArnhem/git-collaboration-exercise).
